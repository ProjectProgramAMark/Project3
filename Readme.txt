Program Includes:
main.cpp CommandProcessor.cpp Menu.cpp
TreeNode.h Heap.h GeneralTree.h AVLTree.h CommandProcessor.h Menu.h

The driver class main.cpp calls the CommandProcessor.cpp function 
Process_Commands(). The Process_Commands() function creates menus and 
prompts user input. The user is able the move through the initial 
menu with the options of creating a Tree, AVLTree, Heap, or 
exiting the program. When the user selects Tree, AVLTree, or Heap,
they are taken to another menu with functions allowing them to create 
and manipulate the data structures.
